Formhandler - Classic Edition for 10.4
======================================

This is the classic Formhandler extension, 2.4.1 - based, 10.4 - compatibility edit.
Main point of doing this is to make updating of older projects as painless and quick as possible.
It bases on 2.4.1 tuned code and tries to keep all classic functionality working as-is,
unlike the one fork with mvc / breaking architecture changes.

Don't use this ext for new projects, it's purpose is maintenance of huge sites with many formulars 
updated to newest TYPO3 and where it's kinda complicated to rewrite all of them to something different.

**IMPORTANT:**
 
WIP 

This code may or may not work for you, I made the changes where I needed for my projects and didn't test
it in many use cases. It should work in basics, though, so give it a try if you need it.

Feel free to help me with this
